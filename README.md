### What is TinyBoy?
**TinyBoy - Open Design 3D Printer for Student  
A small , easy to build , affordable machine**

TinyBoy is an open design 3D printer. The size is just 15 x 15 x 22cm , even smaller than most of the 2D paper printer. Therefore , it fit for regular computer desk. The design aims as an entry-level machine for student and newbie to learn 3D modeling technology and train for creative thinking.

### Less is more

The maximum size of printed object is 8.5 x 8.5 x 8.5cm , which is relatively small than many other 3D printer. However, it is already large enough for making things like figure and toy.  

The gain from the trade off is the cost down of material and maintenance. Take out components for making large printed object , the design become simple and lean. The core material is acrylic sheet and connected by metal screw. Therefore , the cost of material and building can be minimized. The expect bill of material is just around HKD $2,300/ USD $300. 

### Easy to build / Learning by making

The process of making has the opportunity to transform education by inviting students to be something other than consumers of education. They can be maker of anything , moving from being directed to self-directed through the process. 

Tinyboy is designed for easy to build. The assemble from kit can be done by just using a screw driver. We wish student can make their own machine. Then they become a pioneer whose may make another one for other people. So that the use of 3D printer can be spread out to more student.

The case of Tinyboy uses acrylic plane as the main material. Individual parts can be made by using cutter laser. Therefore, the manufacturing process is easy once you have a laser cutter.  In fact , the price of an A5 laser cutter can be as cheap as USD $400. That make the cost of small amount production be reasonably low.
